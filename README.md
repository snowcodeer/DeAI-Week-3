# DeAI-Week-3
## Weekend Project
To consolidate this week's knowledge, students should complete the following project:

Create a GitHub repository for your project
Add all group members as collaborators
Create a README.md file with your project description
Use the story-telling-app as a base repository or create a new application from scratch using NextJS
Implement a table of characters that users can create for the story
Users should be able to add, edit, and delete characters
Each new character should have a name, description, and personality
Customize the prompt to generate a story using user-created characters, if any
Implement a summary of each character's role in the story after the full text has been generated
Test different models for story generation and compare their outputs
Evaluate how well the models "remember" user-created characters
Experiment with different context window sizes across models to observe their impact on output
Test models of varying sizes and observe how this influences the output
Use models compatible with your device, focusing on the experiment rather than overall story quality
Submit your project via the submission form
